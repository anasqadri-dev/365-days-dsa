# 365 Days of DSA — Daily LeetCode Challenge 🚀

## Brief One Line Summary

A 365-day commitment to mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** by solving **one LeetCode problem every day** with clean, consistent Java solutions.

---

## Overview

This repository documents my **365 Days DSA Challenge**, where I solve one Data Structures & Algorithms problem daily and push the solution to GitHub.

The purpose of this challenge is to:

* Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
* Develop long-term consistency
* Cover all major DSA topics in a structured way
* Maintain a public record of learning and discipline

---

## Challenge Structure

The challenge is divided into **8 structured phases**:

### Part 0: Basics (Days 1–12)

* Problem-solving fundamentals
* Arrays & simple logic

### Part 1: Arrays, HashMaps & Strings (Days 13–70)

### Part 2: Sorting, Searching & Sliding Window (Days 71–115)

### Part 3: Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues (Days 116–165)

### Part 4: Recursion, Backtracking & Trees (Days 166–220)

### Part 5: Greedy, Intervals & Bit Manipulation (Days 221–270)

### Part 6: Graphs & Union-Find (Days 271–330)

### Part 7: DP, Trie, Segment Tree & Capstone (Days 331–365)
